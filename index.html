            <p class="p1">
            
            This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature.

            <p class="p3">
              One of the most intelligent AND disturbing horror movies to grace the silver screen in ages. Ari Aster's debut is a masterpiece. {This is how you do art and horror.) What starts as a portrait of grief and multi-generational mommy issues turns into a twisted tale of familial horror, with what has to be the biggest WTF scene of any film in recent memory.
